# Description
Visualizes various statistics on the text being input in real time.  
This repo is for my (almost first) study of JavaScript, jQuery and D3.js.

## Current Issues
+ If the writing is too rapid, the drawing will not function well.
+ It goes slower when continuouely used. (You cannot type much words actually...)
+ The chart is not drawn from first.

## Usage: From local environment (Mac)
In CLS, type
`python3 -m http.server`
and access to http://0.0.0.0:8000/
